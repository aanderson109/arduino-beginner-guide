# A Guide for Getting Started with Arduino #

This guide is primarily intended for someone who is new and looking to jump into the world of Arduino. In this guide, we will go over some basics surrounding the Arduino language along with how to use the board itself. We will explore some of the tutorials that come with the Arduino IDE and add our own twist onto them. Additionally, we will do some projects that apply techniques and concepts learned from those tutorials. The goal is to finish this guide with a basic understanding of the language, the board, and what is possible with the Arduino!

## Prerequisites ##
I assume that you have no knowledge of programming or circuits although any prior knowledge will be of benefit.

## Materials Required ##
To do the tests with us, you'll need an Arduino or an Arduino copy. SparkFun has some reasonably priced ones and you can also order them directly from Arduino's website or on Amazon. Any kind of Arduino will do but I will assume you are using the Arduino Uno R3 since it is the standard beginner Arduino.

You will also need the Arduino IDE downloaded.  A guide for how to download this software can be found in the file "arduinoIDE-guide" at the homepage of this repository.

## About Me ##
I started using Arduino in my undergraduate years at Radford University. Primarily, I used them for some type of scientific application such as experiments/datalogging but my interest in them grew and I have expanded into other avenues of programming. I graduated with a B.S. in Physics, and attend graduate school at George Mason University where I am pursuing a M.S. in Software Engineering.
